# LogisticRegressionModel

## Description
This notebook explores supervised learning techniques using the model-fit-predict pattern with the LogisticRegression model and compares it with results from resampled training data.   This notebook consists of the following: 

- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
- Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data


## Technologies

This example uses the following technologies:

- **Jupyter** - Jupyter is a web-based interactive development environment for data science and analysis. Please see [Jupyter documentation](https://jupyter.org/) for more information.
- **pandas** - pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. Please see [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for more information.
- **Scikit-Learn** - Scikit-Learn is an open-source machine learning library for the Python programming language.  Please see [Scikit-Learn documentation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/scikit_learn/scikit_learn_introduction.htm) for more information.
- **imblearn** - Imbalanced-learn is an open source library that provides tools when dealing with classification with imbalanced classes.  Please see [Imblearn documentation] (https://imbalanced-learn.org/) for more information.
